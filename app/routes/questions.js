The declaration may also provide a link to a text file (i.e., the loose DTD) which the browser uses to obtain further information. It's similar to having a tune-up done on your car. In order to perform it correctly, the mechanic must know the make, model, and year of the car. He must also know how many cylinders the engine has and its horsepower.  Once he knows this, he can move forward and properly tune the engine.",
